# Fire-Notifier-using-Arduino-and-Fire-Sensor
A sensor will monitor the temperature of the house, if the temperature is beyond a threshold limit the sensor will send a notification to your twitter account stating that “Your house is on fire”.

Hardware Requirements
•	Fire sensor
•	Arduino UNO
•	USB cable
•	Jumper cables
•	Lighter


Software Requirements
•	Python IDLE
•	Arduino
•	Twitter Account

  "	The Internet of Things (IoT) in simple words can be described as the network of real or virtual objects or things embedded with electronics, sensors, software’s with network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data, thus providing connectivity at anytime, anyplace for anything and not only for anyone. Through IOT using existing network infrastructure, objects can be sensed and controlled remotely. The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing internet network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration between the real physical world and computer-based virtual systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit. Each and everything would be able to interoperate using embedded computing system existing within the Internet infrastructure which makes them uniquely identifiable. 
	The idea of this project is, a sensor will monitor the temperature of the house, if the temperature is beyond a threshold limit the sensor will send a notification to your twitter account stating that “Your house is on fire”.
